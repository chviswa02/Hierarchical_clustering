# Hierarchical_clustering

PROJECT TITLE:

  Analysis of small customer file.csv of american called as phonix mall find out the basis of client requirement requirement of dendogram using sipy graphics library with help of "scipy.cluster.hirerarchy",to ace the no of linkage of clustering to predict.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

The american finance market clients as per the rate of gdp of 2011 found as highest no of growth in business market.

TASK:

As a data science engineer find out which hierarchy cluster gives maximum linkage in up comming future

TASK-1:
  With the help of scipy library import the library and import the dataset

TASK-2:
  Using the dendogram to find the optimal number of clusters

TASK-3:
  Create a hierarchy model andvisualize the cluster with the help of matplotlib

CONCLUSION:

According to the model building as a engineer my prediction is cluster number 3 has give highest number of linkage

INSIGHTS::

▶Cluster 1 contains the color("Red") which shows un supervised learning cluster has maximum neucliding distance from the centroid up to annual income approximate 139ks

▶Cluster 2 contains the color ("blue") which shows that un supervised learning cluster has maximmum ucliding distance from centroid upto annual income approximately 79 to 80 ks

▶cluster 3 contains the color("green") which shows un superwised learning cluster has maximum eucliding distance from centroid upto annual income upto 140

▶cluster 3 contains the color("skyblue") which shows un superwised learning cluster has maximum eucliding distance from centroid upto annual income upto 42

▶cluster 3 contains the color("pink") which shows un superwised learning cluster has maximum eucliding distance from centroid upto annual income upto 41
